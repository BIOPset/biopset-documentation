# Buying Options Step-By-Step

_In each image in the guide below, the relevant part is circled in purple._

Start by visiting [BIOPset.com](http://biopset.com/).

### Step 1: Connect your wallet

Connect your wallet by pressing the “Connect” Button and selecting your provider.

### Step 2: Set Option size

Enter the amount of \(ETH\) you want to risk in the red box. It must be less then the amount shown next to “max bet size”.

The amount you can win by picking the direction correctly is shown in the blue box under “WIN”. If your bet is to big you will be shown a message here. ![2](https://github.com/BIOPset/gitbook/raw/main/2.png)

_Your maximum earnings are on the right in the blue box_

As you can see there are other options you can configure like the length of your option \(1 hour in the image above\) and the price pair you want to play on \(ETH/USD in the example above\).

The defaults for these settings make it easy to get started and you can dig in and find the best combo for you later on.

### Step 3: Pick your direction

Press the blue “UP” button or the red “DOWN” button to select the direction of your option.

If you pick up and the price goes up in the timeframe, you win. If it goes down, you lose.

_red or blue it's up to you_

### Step 4: Confirm the transaction

confirm the transaction in your wallet. \(Shown here in metamask\).

Don’t send the transaction if your wallet tells you there is a error.

_Picks larger then your gas fee are recommended_

### Step 5: Exercise your option

Once you’ve confirmed the transaction you have two choices:

1. You can sit back and watch for the next dip to buy at.
2. You can visit the Exercise/Expire page to complete your option.

If you don’t want to have to watch your option for the next hour that’s ok. Anyone will be able to complete it for you and they will get a small fee \(~2% of your profits\).

**Want to claim that extra 2% for yourself?** visit the Exercise/Expire page and keep your mouse ready to click. The page updates automatically and as soon as your option is ITM\(in the money\) you can click “exercise” and claim the profits all for yourself.

While your there you can help others \(and **earn a risk free fee for yourself**\) by exercising other options ITM and expiring options that didn’t hit their conditions in the timeframe.

Even if your option choice is wrong you can get some of your money back by expiring it.
