# Benefits

_BIOPset is the world's first decentralized binary options trading protocol. It is built on the Ethereum Network and governed by BIOP tokens._

## What's In It For Me?

Every participant stands to gain something financially for their participation in BIOPset. BIOPset ensures that the following four stakeholders are properly recompensed:

1. Traders.
2. Writers.
3. Interventionists.
4. Governors.

Governors always retain the right to determine exactly how each stakeholder is compensated for their activities.

### Traders

Traders \(or **options traders**\) are actively buying binary options. They can potentially double their wealth if they speculate correctly on price direction.

### Writers

Writers \(or **options writers**\) are passively selling binary options in a pool with other sellers. They are BIOPset's market makers \(or **liquidity providers**\). Liquidity providers earn very competitive yields for market making \(**options writing**\).

### Interventionists

Interventionists receive risk-free fees for providing their services.

{% hint style="info" %}
They intervene on behalf of the options trader by **exercising** in-the-money options. They intervene on behalf of the liquidity provider by **expiring** binary options that have become worthless.
{% endhint %}

### Governors

Governors are responsible for fine tuning BIOPset parameters to ensure a reasonable yield for liquidity providers. Liquidity providers need not governors and vice versa. 

Ideally, governors are also liquidity providers. This aligns shorter-term and longer-term incentive structures.

**Governor's Recompense:** Governors earn transaction fees.

Transaction fees must be enabled through voting.
