# Summary

_BIOPset is the world's first decentralized binary options trading protocol. It is built on the Ethereum Network and governed by BIOP tokens._

\_\_[_Shalaquiana_](https://twitter.com/shalaquiana) _is the pseudonymous founder behind the BIOPset protocol._

## Stakeholders

BIOPset caters to the following classes of stakeholders:

1. Binary options buyers.
2. Binary options sellers.
3. Interventionists.
4. Governors.

The first two stakeholders are counterparties to decentralized derivatives. The second two stakeholders make and fine tune the execution the protocol.

{% hint style="info" %}
Counterparties take opposing sides of a derivative contract. It is impossible to buy derivatives \(like binary options\) without a counterparty willing to sell it.
{% endhint %}

Every participant stands to gain something financially for their participation in BIOPset.

### Binary Options Buyers

Binary options buyers \(or "**options holders**"\) are actively speculating on the direction of price movements. They are the chief users of the BIOPset platform and known as **options traders** in BIOPset nomenclature.

Options traders are active users in BIOPset.
{% endhint %}

**Buyer's Recompense:** Options traders can double their wealth if they speculate correctly on price direction.

### Binary Options Sellers

Binary options sellers \(or "**options writers**"\) are the counterparty to binary options buyers. In BIOPset, they pool their funds together to function as passive counterparties to options traders. They are known as **liquidity providers** \(or **market makers**\) in BIOPset nomeclature.

{% hint style="info" %}
Liquidity providers are passive users in BIOPset.
{% endhint %}

Although BIOPset's infrastructure primarily provides a service to binary options buyers, it is the passive pool of options sellers that provide the liquidity for the service to work.  They are like vendors that set up a shop and bring a market to life.

**Writer's Recompense:** Liquidity providers earn very competitive yields for market making \(options writing\).

### Interventionists

Interventionists are humans \(or bots\) that facilitate the realization of a gain for either the options trader or the liquidity provider.

They intervene on behalf of the options trader by **exercising** in-the-money options. They intervene on behalf of the liquidity provider by **expiring** binary options that have become worthless.

**Inverventionist's Recompense:** Interventionists receive risk-free fees for providing their services.

### Governors

Governors are responsible for fine tuning BIOPset parameters to ensure a reasonable yield for liquidity providers. Liquidity providers need not governors and vice versa. 

Ideally, governors are also liquidity providers. This aligns shorter-term and longer-term incentive structures.

**Governor's Recompense:** Governors earn transaction fees.

{% hint style="info" %}
Transaction fees must be enabled through voting.
